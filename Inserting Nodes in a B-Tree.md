# Ex. No: 16C - Inserting Nodes in a B-Tree in Python

## AIM:
To write a Python function `def insert(self, k):` to insert the nodes in a **B-Tree**.

---

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Start the program.

**Step 2**: Define the `BTreeNode` class to represent a node:
- Contains a list of keys.
- Contains a list of children.
- Indicates whether it is a leaf.

**Step 3**: Define the `BTree` class with:
- Methods for inserting keys.
- Handling node splitting.
- Tree traversal and printing.

**Step 4**: Implement `insert()`:
- Insert a key into the tree.
- Handle full root case and invoke node splitting if needed.

**Step 5**: Implement `insert_non_full()` to insert a key into a node that is not full.

**Step 6**: Implement `split_child()` to split a full child during insertion.

**Step 7**: Define `print_tree()` to recursively print the structure of the B-Tree.
